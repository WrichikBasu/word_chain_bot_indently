#### Where is the public version of the bot hosted?
The bot instance used in the Indently server is hosted on [bot-hosting.net](https://bot-hosting.net/?aff=1024746441798856717).
The free node they offer at zero cost works excellent compared to free nodes offered by other hosts. 
A premium node can also be purchased at a very cheap rate, which is what we use.

### What is the word chain game?
It's a simple game where you have to enter a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word. You cannot enter two words in a row, so this is a multi-player game. The aim is to make the chain as long as possible. Entering a wrong word or a word with a typo breaks the chain and you start from square one again.

### Required environment variables
To host the bot yourself, you will need to set the following environment variables in `.env`:
- `TOKEN="xyz"` : You will get this from the [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/) website under the `Bot` section after creating a new application.
- `ADMIN_GUILD_ID="1234"` : The ID of the server that you want to designate as the admin guild, where admin commands like `/prune` can be run.
- `DEV_MODE="True"` or `"False"` : Optional flag to prevent the bot from automatically syncing the slash ccommands every time it restarts. Set it to `True` if you are testing the bot, and sync manually via the `/sync` command. Can be removed in the production version.

Or maybe just use the public version to keep things simple, unless you are developing with the intention of contributing to the codebase.
